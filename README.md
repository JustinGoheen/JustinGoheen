Hi! I'm Justin and I'm "focused on developing tools, systems, and processes to enable the application of artificial intelligence in real-world contexts" [(SEI-CMU)](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/our-work/artificial-intelligence-engineering/).

My primary focus with regard to community contribution is on developing and improving [lightning-pod](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod) as a resource for individuals who are new to machine learning or deep learning, or who are new pytorch-lightning users. `lightning-pod` also places additional emphasis on Python best practices and software engineering skills for researchers in order to close any skill gaps left by theory based courses.

Check out my contributions to Lightning in my [contributions project](https://github.com/users/JustinGoheen/projects/16).

Aside from my work here, you can also check out what I've shared on my Lightning [profile](https://lightning.ai/JustinGoheen/apps) and my [blog](https://justingoheen.github.io/wiki/).
