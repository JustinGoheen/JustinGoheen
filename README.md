Hi! I'm Justin and I'm "focused on developing tools, systems, and processes to enable the application of artificial intelligence in real-world contexts" [(SEI-CMU)](https://www.sei.cmu.edu/our-work/artificial-intelligence-engineering/).

My focus with regard to community contributions is on contributing to [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai) as a [community ambassador](https://lightning.ai/pages/ambassador-program/), and maintaining [lightning-pod](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod) and [lightning-pod-example](https://github.com/JustinGoheen/lightning-pod-example) as a resource for individuals who are new to AI and machine learning, or who are new Lightning users.

My personal focus is on developing financial trading applications with [IEX](https://iexcloud.io) and [IBKR APIs](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ib-api.php) as [Lightning Apps](https://lightning.ai/docs/stable/). More specifically, I am interested in understanding the intersection of machine learning techniques and optimization in finance to design intelligent systems for trend following in equity futures; where these systems may range from being completely automated with no human in the loop (aside from monitoring), to using machine intelligence to amplify a human trader's market awareness with bespoke metrics that they will use to place discretionary trades. These systems may use single agents or ensembles of agents that vary in type ([reflex,..., learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent)) and style of learning (supervised,..., self-supervised).

My academic credentials include an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning from [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/cci/academics/masters-programs/ms-in-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/) and a B.A. in Finance from [Florida Atlantic University](https://business.fau.edu).

Aside from my work here, you can also check out what I've shared on my Lightning [profile](https://lightning.ai/JustinGoheen/apps) and in my [blog](https://justingoheen.github.io/blog/).
